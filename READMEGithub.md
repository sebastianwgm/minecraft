In this project, Lamha and I developed a procedural walking simulator inspired by Minecraft, featuring both CPU-based terrain generation and GPU-accelerated procedural texture synthesis utilizing Perlin noise. For the terrain, we employed multi-octave value noise to generate a 3x3 seamless chunk region around the initial player location.

We created procedural textures using both static and time-varying Perlin noise.

Additionally, we pioneered the use of 3D Perlin noise for true volumetric terrain generation. To render the terrain blocks, we applied 3D Perlin noise with variable opacity settings to selectively draw cubes, enhancing the volumetric effect. The implementation is similar to 2D perlin noise except that we implemented the 3D perlin noise on the CPU instead of the GPU:
